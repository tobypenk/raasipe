            RaaSipe is the project of Phinneasticus T. Barchbellow, known to the IRS as "Toby Penk." At left is the only known image of Barchbellow, taken moments before his historic arrest by Ottoman officials for conspiring with Gavrilo Princip to plunge the civilized world into existential conflict.

        <p class="content-paragraph">
            If I wanted to hear you pontificate on the virtues of cashew- vs. almond-butter, I'd attend your one-woman show in Portland. For now, I just want a recipe, and I don't want to scroll past seventy-five pages of rambling diatribe / rhapsody / fever-dream to finally get to the actual recipe and learn that it sucks. I also don't want dozens of high-resolution images that add even more inches of scrolling and make the actual recipe jump around as the images load in fits and starts on my crappy internet connection. Let me make my own stories, and let me make my own images. The real-life kind of images. You know, actual food.

        <h2 class="underline">The Tyranny of SEOppressive Search Engines</h2>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            I don't blame the aspiring blogopracter for employing these methods; in fact, it's crazy not to, because if you don't, you'll be as invisible to search engines as a 9th-grade chess champion is to its dating prospects. All those words are the equivalent of seduction, search-engine style. Come on, babe, I'm totally relevant. No, I would never trick people into reading pointless drivel just by including paragraph upon paragraph of blatantly pandering keywords. I'm genuine. I'm relatable. I'm an influencer, whatever that means. Just gimme a chance to serve up that sweet, sweet content.

        <h2 class="underline">Well, What's so Great About YOUR Stupid Website, Smart Guy?</h2>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Wow. I thought we'd built up some rapport over the last couple paragraphs, but I suppose you set higher standards than the average search engine. I guess I respect that.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
            My goal with RaaSipe is to ameliorate a(n) historical accident: the fact that the recipe was invented well before the computer. If we invented recipes today, they'd be incredible, multi-functional works of technological art. You'd be able to
            
            <br>
            <br>
            - Size the calorie, fat, carb, and protein contents of any recipe, based on the ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            - Change the quantity of any ingredient and have the recipe change the quantities of everything else in proportion.
            <br>
            - Substitute ingredients and see the effect that would have on the nutrition of the recipe.</li>
            <br>
            - Consolidate grocery lists across multiple recipes and text them to yourself to take to the store.
            <br>
            - Exclude recipes that require equipment you don't own, and use the recipe as a link to get the proper equipment.
            <br>
            - Exclude recipes that violate your dietary restrictions, and use the recipe to find substitutes that will help you keep kosher (or vegetarian, or vegan, or etc etc).
            <br>
            - Cook any recipe, no matter how "fancy," because it would be presented in a way that makes it foolproof (I apologize for insinuating that you're a fool - it's just a word).
            <br>
            <br>
            As a result, you'd learn to cook faster and better, and there would be no such thing as a difficult recipe. After all, a recipe is nothing but a list of inputs and a list of instructions. Even puppies can follow instructions. Are you stupider than a puppy?
